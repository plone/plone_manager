# plone-manager

**Checkout and run to see plone-manager in action**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/plone/plone-manager
# You can use npm if you want
yarn install
# You need electron on your machine (npm install -g electron)
electron .
```

**Use this app**

This is an experiment to have a possible ZMI kind of tool to manage the content form a desktop app.

ALERT : Nowadays only works on plone.server, planning to adapt to plone.restapi

When the electron app is on you can set the settings for your plone site and save them.

Then you have the option to browse the content, see the registry and the content types of the site

**TODO**

* Nicer UI
* Schema angular 2 form to edit content
* Edit registry
* Support plone.restapi API
